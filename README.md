# Game of Patterns

Why have I named this project "Game of Patterns"? Because the main goal I followed was learning a lot of OOP design patterns (see below).
It means that that the core value of this project lies in the code.

## Used patterns

* **Singleton**. Used in designing Field class.

* **Iterator**. Used for implementing iterating over a Field object.

* **Strategy**. Used for implementing different kinds of player's interaction with different objects on a game field.

* **Observer**. Used for implementing logging.

* **Bridge**. Used for separating different Loggers types.

* **Command**. Used for performing different player's action on a game field.

* **State**. Used for implementation player's and NPCs' turns (not very good solution, but I was forced to use it).

* **Memento**. Used for implementation of game saving and loading.

## TODO

- [ ] Randomly generated map
- [ ] Some semblance of AI for NPCs
- [ ] Frontend refactoring: new sprites, new fonts, animations, etc.
